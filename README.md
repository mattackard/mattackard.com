# Mattackard.com

[Mattackard.com](https://mattackard.com) is my development portfolio website where I host my projects and provide links to my professional social media profiles.

## About the site

The site is built with plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript with an external JS module called [ScrollReveal](https://scrollrevealjs.org/api/reveal.html) to animate content to make the page more interesting. I used CSS grid to align my content, which I chose because I generally use flexbox with my positioning and I figured it would be a good opportunity to use CSS Grid with a simple layout.
