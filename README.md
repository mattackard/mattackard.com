# Mattackard.com

[Mattackard.com](https://mattackard.com) is my web development portfolio website where I host my projects and provide links to my professional social media profiles.

## About the site

I didn't feel it would be necessary to build my portfolio website with too much complexity. I treat my portfolio site more as a means to an end where prospective employers can quickly see a summary of my web projects. There are links to the source and live versions of each site for a more in-depth look at each project's contents.

The site is built with plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript with an external JS module called [ScrollReveal](https://scrollrevealjs.org/api/reveal.html) to animate content to make the page more interesting. I used CSS grid to align my content, which I chose because I generally use flexbox with my positioning and I figured it would be a good opportunity to use CSS Grid with a simple layout.
